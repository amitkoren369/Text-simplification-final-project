# Text simplification
The Text Simplification task involves modifying the content and structure of a text to make it easier to read and understand while retaining the underlying meaning of the text. A simplified version of a text can benefit a broad range of readers. The main approaches to text simplification are Lexical Simplification and Syntactic Simplification.

In this Project, we aim to extend the conventional text simplification task by performing simplification at various reading levels. We accomplish this by training our language model on a quality data set constructed from multiple sources. The data set contains sentences at three different difficulty levels, enabling the model to simplify text across a range of reading levels. We ran the ,odel on relatively low compute resources(Google colab).
